# Goals:
With this mod I'd like to provide a more engaging, enjoyable, and balanced potion brewing experience (possibly extending beyond just potions, but for now we're keeping the scope down). The experience I want to provide will be more based in actual alchemical principles - Breaking things down into their basic elements, then converting that elemental energy into potions. (obviously still not what real alchemy is about, but I'm not doing "lead to gold".) So what we'll need is...

# Todo:

### High-level tasks:

- [ ] A way to break down materials into essences // currently planned to be a seperate crafting station
- [ ] A way to store essences // planned to be done using normal potion vials
- [ ] A way to convert essences into potions
- [ ] Multiple crafting stations for performing alchemy // for example essentially a magic grill
- [ ] Food crafting using these crafting stations

### Current Tasks:

- [x] Add a crucible/multiple crucibles (will serve as the primary block class for brewing)
- [x] Create a simple system to take input items, destroy them, and fill up magic counters in the TileEntity

- [ ] Create a small set of items' essences to test the system

- [ ] Create way to begin brewing a potion instead of breaking down items (reducing heat?) and implement potion brewing

- [ ] Create a small set of potions to consume the essences
