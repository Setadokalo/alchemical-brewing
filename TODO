/*
	With this mod I'd like to provide a more engaging, enjoyable, and balanced potion brewing experience
	(possibly extending beyond just potions, but for now we're keeping the scope down).
	The experience I want to provide will be more based in actual alchemical principles - Breaking things down
	into their basic elements, then converting that elemental energy into potions. (obviously still not what real alchemy
	is about, but I'm not doing "lead to gold".)
	So what we'll need is...

High-level tasks:
  ☐ A way to break down materials into essences
  ☐ A way to store essences
